# Text Swap AFU

This package contains RTL and C test code for an AFU accelerated text searching and
replacing. It works using IBM's Coherent Accelerator Processor Interface.

To get started, if this is an initial clone of the repositor, you should
initialize the submodules:

git submodule update --init

After that is done, configure the project:

./waf configure

This will check for the required dependancies. If it doesn't succeed, please
find the missing components and re-run until it does.

Once the configuration passes, you may build the C code with:

./waf

## Running Simulations

To run a simulation, use the ./sim script. Currently only Cadence's ncsim tools
are supported. You may select a binary to run with the -e option (it defaults to
'textswap') and you may pass additional arguments to this binary by passing them
after a '--'. For example, to simulate unittest with random data run:

./sim -e unittest -- -R

## Running on Hardware

To run on actual powerpc hardware you must configure the code specially:

./waf configure --hardware

Then you may rebuild the code and run the binaries normally:

./waf
build/unittest -R
